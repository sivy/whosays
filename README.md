# whosays

whosays is a fun little random quote app that I started to spit out [R.E.M.](http://remhq.com) quotes on <http://rem.wallrazer.com>. I'm working on generalizing it so that anyone can use it.

## dependencies

* python-twitter
* oauthtwitter

Um, Twitter support presently doesn't work b/c I never implemented the Oauth support. That's coming.
